Hello everyone,

Here, at Access Softek we collect buildbot numbers we think the LLVM community would be interested to check. In this post we’d like to share the following stats for the period of 03.08.2020 – 03.14.2020:

* The longest time each builder was red during the week;
* "Status change ratio" by active builder (percent of builds that changed the
builder status from green to red or from red to green);
* Number of commits by project;
* Number of completed builds, failed builds and an average build time for
successful builds per active builder;
* Average waiting time for a revision to get build result per active builder
(response time).

You can also download these stats in .csv – please find the links below. 

Thanks,
Galina
