<h1>About Access Softek Toolchains</h1>
<p>Access Softek Toolchains is an active contributor and a partner of the open technology ecosystem – the LLVM Project.</p>  
<p>We also help our customers to drive adoption of the LLVM infrastructure and get the best possible software development tools.</p>
<p>We have been involved in the creation and maintenance of compiler toolchains for many different targets. Some, like ARM, are common now, and some are still quite unique in the areas of microcontrollers, SoCs and DSPs.</p>
<p>From early on in LLVM’s origins, we have worked on a number of projects such as a front-end compiler, back-end code generation and optimization, linkers and code instrumentation.</p> 
<p>Currently we have a full stack engineering team of 20+ compiler developers, 4 code owners and 1 of our people is on the <a href="https://llvm.org/foundation/" target="_blank">LLVM foundation board</a>.</p>      
<p>We host the LLVM Lab in our office in Berkeley, California and manage the continued integration (LLVM buildbot) for all projects under the LLVM umbrella.</p> 
<p>We’re also proud to be one of the <a href="https://llvm.org/foundation/sponsors.html" target="_blank">sponsors</a> of the LLVM foundation.</p> 
<p>On this blog we’ll be sharing the most exciting LLVM news, insights and details about the work we do.</p>

<h2>Our Customers</h2>
<p>Access Softek Toolchains collaborated with dozens of technology partners from Fortune 500 companies, including <b>Google</b>, <b>Sony</b> and <b>Nintendo</b>.</p> 
<p>We’d like to be able to tell you more about our clients and projects, but it wouldn’t make them happy.</p>
<p>While NDAs restrict our ability to provide more details, we can tell that our work on LLVM allowed the companies to replace their previous technology with superior solutions, resulting in improvements for tens of thousands of developers.</p>
<p>Watch this video from the LLVM Developers’ Meeting where one of our clients, Nintendo, share how they converted from using proprietary tools and libraries to the LLVM-based developer toolchain:</p>
